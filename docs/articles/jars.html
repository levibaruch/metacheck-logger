<p>JARS (journal article reporting standards), by the American
Psychological Association offer guidance on the information that should
be reported in scientific articles to enhance their scientific rigour
<span class="citation">(Appelbaum et al. 2018)</span>. The guidelines
for quantitative research are a set of excellent recommendations, and
almost every published scientific article would be improved if
researchers actually followed JARS.</p>
<p>However, as the guidelines are not well known, authors usually do not
implement them, and reviewers do not check if journal article reporting
standards are followed. Furthermore, there are so many guidelines, it
would take a lot of time to check them all manually. Automation can help
increase awareness of JARS by systematically checking if recommendations
are followed, and if not, point out where improvements can be made.
Below we will illustrate how 2 JARS guidelines can be automatically
checked. There are dozens of other potential guidelines for which
dedicated metacheck modules could be created. Anyone who has created an
R package will have the experience of running R CMD check, which
automatically checks dozens of requirements that an R package must
adhere to before it is allowed on CRAN. It should be possible to
automatically check many of the JARS guidelines in a similar manner.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="exact-p-values">Exact p-values<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exact-p-values"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first reporting guideline we will illustrate is to report exact
p-values. The APA Manual states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Report exact p values (e.g., p = .031) to two or three decimal
places. However, report p values less than .001 as p &lt; .001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reporting <em>p</em> values precisely allows readers to include the
test results in <em>p</em> value meta-analytic tests, such as p-curve,
or z-curve <span class="citation">(Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons 2014;
Bartoš and Schimmack 2020)</span>, and makes it possible the check the
internal coherence of the reported result with tools such as Statcheck
<span class="citation">(Nuijten et al. 2015)</span>. metacheck has a
dedicated module, “exact-p”, to identify the presence of imprecise
p-values. We can run it on a single paper:</p>

<p>We found 9 imprecise <em>p</em> values. Reporting <em>p</em> values
imprecisely (e.g., <em>p</em> &lt; .05) reduces transparency,
reproducibility, and re-use (e.g., in <em>p</em> value meta-analyses).
Best practice is to report exact p-values with three decimal places
(e.g., <em>p</em> = .032) unless <em>p</em> values are smaller than
0.001, in which case you can use <em>p</em> &lt; .001.</p>

The APA manual states: Report exact *p* values (e.g., *p* = .031) to two or three decimal places. However, report *p* values less than .001 as *p* &lt; .001. However, 2 decimals is too imprecise for many use-cases (e.g., a *p* value meta-analysis), so report *p* values with three digits.

American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association 2020: the official guide to APA style (7th ed.). American Psychological Association.

:::

The module only returns the exact *p* values, but the metacheck software has several convenient functions to interact with the information in scientific manuscripts. The `expand_text` function can be used to retrieve text around matches (for example by retrieving the previous and next sentence as well). We can retrieve the full sentence so that users can easily examine whether the reported *p* values should have been precise:

  results_table = res_imprecise,

<p>A second JARS guideline that can be automatically checked is whether
people report effect sizes alongside their test result. Each test (e.g.,
a <em>t</em>-test, <em>F</em>-test, etc.) should include the
corresponding effect size (e.g., a Cohen’s d, or partial eta-squared).
Based on a text search that uses regular expressions (regex), we can
identify <em>t</em>-tests and <em>F</em>-tests that are not followed by
an effect size, and warn researchers accordingly.</p>

<p>:::</p>
<p>This can be useful for meta-scientific research questions, such as
whether there is an increase in the best practice to report effect sizes
for <em>t</em>-tests over time. In the plot below we have run the module
on 1838 published articles in the journal Psychological Science between
2014 and 2024. We can see that where a decade ago, close to half the
reported t-tests would not be followed by an effect size, but a decade
later, this holds for only around 25% of tests. Perhaps the introduction
of a tool like metacheck can reduce this percentage even further
(although it does not need to be 0, as we discuss below).</p>
<p>Our main point is to demonstrate that it is relatively easy to answer
some meta-scientific questions with metacheck. Editors could easily
replicate the plot below for articles in their own journal, and see
which practices they should improve. As we highlighted in the <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2025/06/introducing-metacheck.html" class="external-link">introductory
blog post</a>, when modules are used for metascience, they need to be
validated, and have low error rates. We have manually checked the
<em>t</em>-tests and <em>F</em>-tests in 250 papers in Psychological
Science, and our effect_size module detected 100% of <em>t</em>-tests
with effect sizes, 99% of <em>t</em>-tests without effect sizes, 99% of
<em>F</em>-tests with effect sizes, and 100% of <em>F</em>-tests without
effect sizes. This is accurate enough for meta-scientific research.</p>

<p>These two examples are relatively straightforward examples of text
searches that can identify examples where researchers do not follow
reporting guidelines. Still, these algorithms can be improved.</p>
<p>For example, the module to detect effect sizes following t-tests only
matches standardized effect sizes, but it is not always necessary to
compute a standardized effect size. If a future meta-analysis would be
based on raw scores, and means and standard deviations are reported, it
might not be needed to report an effect size. Alternatively, we might
just accept a tool that has a relatively high Type 1 error rate when
checking our manuscript. After all, a spellchecker has a high Type 1
error rate, underlining many names and abbreviations that are correct,
but that it does not recognize, and most people use spellcheckers all
the time, as any errors they successfully catch make it worthwhile to
read over the Type 1 errors and dismiss them. Despite the room for
improvement, even these simple text searches can already identify places
where published articles could have been improved by adding effect
sizes.</p>
<p>There are many more algorithms that can be added to detect other
information that should be reported according to the JARS guidelines. If
you would like to create and/or validate such a module, do reach out. We
are happy to collaborate.</p>

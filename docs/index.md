# metacheck

Metacheck provides extendable and integrated tools for automatically
checking research outputs for best practices. (formerly named
papercheck)

Inspired by practices in software development, where automated checks
(e.g., CRAN checks for R packages) are used to identify issues before
release, metacheck aims to screen scientific manuscripts to identify
potential issues or areas for improvement and guide researchers in
adopting best practices. It can also assist with processing large
numbers of papers for metascientific enquiry.

See [Get

for the basics,
[Articles](https://scienceverse.github.io/metacheck/articles/) for more
detailed examples of what you can do, or our [introductory blog
post](https://scienceverse.github.io/metacheck/articles/intro.md) for a
more conceptual overview.

## The Team

Metacheck is developed by a collaborative team of researchers,
consisting of (from left to right in the picture below) [Lisa
DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io) (developer and maintainer),
[Daniël Lakens](https://sites.google.com/site/lakens2/Home) (developer),
[René Bekkers](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/rene-bekkers)
(collaborator and PI of [Transparency
Check](https://tdcc.nl/tdcc-ssh-challenge-projects/research-transparency-check)),
[Cristian
Mesquida](https://ssreplicationcentre.com/author/cristian-mesquida/)
(postdoctoral researcher), and [Max
Littel](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/max-littel-a0620a233/nl), [Jakub
Werner](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/jakubwerner), [Hadeel
Khawatmy](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/hadeel-khawatmy-a720021a2), and
[Lavinia Ion](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/lavinia-i-05275636b) (research
assistants).

Metacheck was initially developed by Lisa and Daniël in 2024 during
Lisa’s visiting professorship at the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence
Systems Institute
([EAISI](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute)).

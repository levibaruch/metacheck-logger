# Update FReD

metacheck comes with a built-in data frame called `FReD`. We update it
regularly, but you can use this function to download the newest version.
The download is \>5MB, but this function will summarise the information
into a smaller version and delete the original file.

## Usage

``` r
FReD_update()
```

## Value

the path to the data frame (invisibly)

# Convert a PDF to Grobid XML

This function uses a public grobid server maintained by Patrice Lopez.
You can set up your own local grobid server following instructions from
<https://grobid.readthedocs.io/> and set the argument `grobid_url` to
its path (probably <http://localhost:8070>)

## Usage

``` r
pdf2grobid(
  filename,
  save_path = ".",
  grobid_url = "https://kermitt2-grobid.hf.space",
  start = -1,
  end = -1,
  consolidate_citations = 0,
  consolidate_header = 0,
  consolidate_funders = 0
)
```

## Arguments

- filename:

  path to the PDF, a vector of paths, or a directory name that contains
  PDFs

- save_path:

  directory or file path to save to; set to NULL to save to a temp file

- grobid_url:

  the URL to the grobid server

- start:

  the first page of the PDF to read (defaults to -1 to read all pages)

- end:

  the last page of the PDF to read (defaults to -1 to read all pages)

- consolidate_citations:

  whether to fix/enhance citations

- consolidate_header:

  whether to fix/enhance paper info

- consolidate_funders:

  whether to fix/enhance funder info

## Value

XML object

## Details

Consolidation of citations, headers, and funders looks up these items in
CrossRef or another database to fix or enhance information (see
<https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Consolidation/>). This can slow
down conversion. Consolidating headers is only useful for published
papers, and can be set to 0 for work in prep.

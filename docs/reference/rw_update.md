# Update retractionwatch

metacheck comes with a built-in data frame called `retractionwatch`. We
update it regularly, but you can use this function to download the
newest version. The download is \>50MB, but this function will summarise
the information into a smaller version (~0.5 MB) and delete the original
file.

## Usage

``` r
rw_update()
```

## Value

the path to the data frame (invisibly)

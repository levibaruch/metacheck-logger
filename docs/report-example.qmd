:::

[Metacheck](https://www.scienceverse.org/metacheck/) is a tool that screens scientific manuscripts and aims to identify potential issues for improvement, thereby guiding researchers towards best practices. Metacheck is developed to help researchers correctly and completely report statistical results, automatically retrieve possible relevant information about citations, and improve how researchers share data, code, and preregistrations.

::: {.callout-tip title="Learn More" collapse="true"}

Metacheck combines existing and new checks in a module-based tool. It mainly relies on text search, retrieving information from external sources through API’s or web-scraping, but it also incorporates tool that use machine learning classifiers or large language models. The use of LLM’s is always optional. The development of Metacheck is guided by our [values statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbIkgUaiz3fpTXAeTF3h-gsfhqWEBN_n6OBcbFLfXjw/edit?tab=t.0). 

Metacheck often needs to balance false positives against false negatives, and prioritizes preventing false negatives. Like a spelling checker, which often highlights words that are not spelled incorrectly, Metacheck modules will contain false positives. We hope their rate is acceptable, given opportunities for improvement that Metacheck identifies. Modules are currently primarily validated on the psychological literature.

Metacheck is under continuous development. Issues can be submitted [on Github](https://github.com/scienceverse/metacheck/issues), and suggestions for improvement or feedback can be sent to D.Lakens@tue.nl.

## General Modules

### ⚠️ COI Check {#coi-check .red}

No conflict of interest statement was detected. Consider adding one.

::: {.callout-note title="How It Works" collapse="true"}

Identify and extract Conflicts of Interest (COI) statements.

The COI Check module uses regular expressions to check sentences for words related to conflict of interest statements. It will return the sentences in which the conflict of interest statement was found.

The function was inspired by [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent), which is no longer maintained. For their validation, see [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107).

Our version uses a more inclusive algorithm, which decreases false negatives (missing a potential COI) at the expense of increasing false positives (falsely detecting sentences as a COI statement).

### ⚠️ Funding Check {#funding-check .red}

No funding statement was detected. Consider adding one.

::: {.callout-note title="How It Works" collapse="true"}

Identify and extract funding statements.

The Funding Check module uses regular expressions to check sentences for words related to funding statements. It will return the sentences in which the conflict of interest statement was found.

The function was inspired by [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent), which is no longer maintained. For their validation, see [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107).

### ✅️ Open Practices Check {#open-practices-check .green}

Shared data and code detected.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

Data was openly shared for this article, based on the following text:

> Data is also available from <https://osf.io/5tbm9> and code is also available from <https://osf.io/629bx>.

Code was openly shared for this article, based on the following text:

> Data and analysis code is available on GitHub from <https://github.com/Lakens/to_err_is_human> and from <https://researchbox.org/4377>.

</div></details>

::: {.callout-note title="How It Works" collapse="true"}

This module incorporates ODDPub into metacheck. ODDPub is a text mining algorithm that detects which publications disseminated Open Data or Open Code together with the publication.

The Open Practices Check runs Open Data Detection in Publications (ODDPub). ODDPub searches for text expressions that indicate that an article shared Open Data or Open Code together with the publication. More information on the package can be found at <https://github.com/quest-bih/oddpub>. The module only returns whether open data and code is found (the original package offers more fine-grained results). The tool was validated in the biomedical literature, see <https://osf.io/yv5rx/>.

ODDPub was developed by Nico Riedel, Vladislav Nachev, Miriam Kip, and Evgeny Bobrov at the QUEST Center for Transforming Biomedical Research, Berlin Institute of Health. <https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-042>

It might miss open data and code declarations when the words used in the manuscript are not in the pattern that ODDPub searches for, or when the repositories are not in the ODDpub code (e.g., ResearchBox).

## Method Modules

### ⚠️ Power Analysis Check {#power-analysis-check .red}

We detected 2 potential power analyses.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

Some essential information could not be detected: sample_size, power, software

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list(power_id = 1:2, power_type = c("sensitivity", 
"posthoc"), statistical_test = c("t-test", "t-test"), sample_size = c(50L, 
NA), alpha_level = c(0.05, 0.05), power = c(0.8, NA), effect_size = c(0.5, 
0.59), effect_size_metric = c("Cohen's d", "Cohen's d"), software = c("other", 
NA)), row.names = c(NA, -2L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 5, FALSE)
```

You reported a power analysis that has been classified as 'post-hoc'. Calculating observed power is [almost never useful](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/08-samplesizejustification.html#sec-posthocpower). If you actually performed a sensitivity power analysis, label it as such explicitly.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list(power_id = "1;2", text = "In this study we examine whether automated checks reduce the amount of errors that researchers make in scientific manuscripts. This study was preregistered at <https://osf.io/48ncu> and on AsPredicted at <https://aspredicted.org/by8i8v.pdf>. We randomly assigned 50 scientists to a condition where their manuscript was automatically checked for errors, and 50 scientists to a control condition with a checklist. Scientists had the opportunity to make changes to their manuscript based on the feedback of the tool. We subsequently coded all manuscripts for mistakes, and counted the total number of mistakes. We also measured the expertise of researchers (in years) to explore whether the automated tool would be more useful, the less research experience researchers had. We also asked researchers to rate how useful they found the checklist or app on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely useful). Data and analysis code is available on GitHub from <https://github.com/Lakens/to_err_is_human> and from <https://researchbox.org/4377>. Data is also available from <https://osf.io/5tbm9> and code is also available from <https://osf.io/629bx>. We conducted a <strong>sensitivity</strong> <strong>power</strong> analysis to determine that a Cohen's d of 0.50 is the smallest effect size that we could detect with 50 participants in each group and 80% <strong>power</strong>. On average researchers in the experimental (app) condition made fewer mistakes (M = 9.12) than researchers in the control (checklist) condition (M = 10.9), t(97.7) = 2.9, p = 0.005, d = 0.59."), row.names = c(NA, 
-1L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 1, FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Learn More" collapse="true"}

Power analyses need to contain the following information to be interpretable: the type of power analysis, the statistical test, the software used, sample size, critical alpha criterion, power level, effect size, and an effect size metric. In addition, it is recommended to make sure the power analysis is reproducible (by sharing the code, or a screenshot, of the power analysis), and to provide good arguments for why the study was designed to detect an effect of this size.

For an a-priori power analysis, where the sample size is determined, reporting all information would look like:

> An a priori power analysis for an independent samples t-test, conducted using the pwr.t.test function from pwr (Champely, 2020), indicated that for a Cohen's d = 0.5, an alpha level of 0.05, and a desired power level of 80% required at least 64 participants in each group.

For a sensitivity power analysis, this sentence would look like:

> A sensitivity power analysis for an independent samples t-test, conducted using the pwr.t.test function from pwr (Champely, 2020), indicated that with 64 participants in each group, and an alpha level of 0.05, a desired power level of 80% was reached for an effect size of d = 0.5.

:::

</div></details>

::: {.callout-note title="How It Works" collapse="true"}

This module uses a large language module (LLM) to extract information reported in power analyses, including the statistical test, sample size, alpha level, desired level of power,and magnitude and type of effect size.

If you have not set llm_use(TRUE) and supplied a groq API, the module will return paragraphs that potentially contain power analyses, based on a regular expression search.

The Power Analysis Check module uses regular expressions to identify sentences that contain a statistical power analysis. Without the use of an LMM, the module uses regular expressions to classify the power analysis as a-priori, sensitivity or post-hoc. With the use of an LMM, it checks if the power analysis is reported with all required information.

The regular expressions can miss power analyses, or fail to classify them correctly. The type of power analysis is often difficult to classify, which can easily be solved by explicitly specifying the type of power analysis as 'a-priori', 'sensitivity', or 'post-hoc'. Note that 'post-hoc' or 'observed' power is rarely useful. The LMM can fail to identify information in the paper, and will not have access to information in paragraphs in the paper other than those that contain the word 'power'. This package was validated by the Metacheck team on articles in Psychological Science.

### ✅️ Randomization and Causal Claims {#randomization-and-causal-claims .green}

-  We identified 1 sentence describing randomization.
-  No causal claims were observed in the title.
-  No causal claims were observed in the abstract.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

Journal Article Reporting Standards require details about randomization procedures, or how possible bias due to non-randomization is mitigated. This information is often not reported. Furthermore, researchers sometimes make causal claims that are not warranted, for example because there was no random assignment to conditions. This module checks how (non)randomization is reported, and checks for causal claims in the title and abstract. Researchers are asked to double check whether this information is reported completely and correctly.

#### Randomization

We identified 1 sentence describing randomization.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list("We randomly assigned 50 scientists to a condition where their manuscript was automatically checked for errors, and 50 scientists to a control condition with a checklist."), names = "", class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, 
-1L))

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 2, FALSE)
```

If this was a study that contained random assignment to conditions, the journal article reporting standards (JARS) ask that you describe the following:

1. Random assignment method: Procedure used to generate the random assignment sequence, including details of any restriction (e.g., blocking, stratification)

2. Random assignment concealment: Whether sequence was concealed until interventions were assigned

3. Random assignment implementation: Who generated the assignment sequence, who enrolled participants, who assigned participants to groups

#### Causal Claims

No causal claims were observed in the title.

No causal claims were observed in the abstract.

::: {.callout-tip title="Learn More" collapse="true"}

</div></details>

::: {.callout-note title="How It Works" collapse="true"}

Aims to identify the presence of random assignment, and lists sentences that make causal claims in title or abstract.

The Randomization and Causal Claims Check first uses regular expressions to check whether the manuscript contains a statement about randomization to conditions. Subsequently, it sends the title and abstract to a [machine learning classifier developed by Rasoul Norouzi](https://github.com/rasoulnorouzi/causal_relation_miner) that runs on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lakens/causal_sentences). Causal statements are identified. Researchers are recommended to double check if causal statements are warranted, especially if no sentences describing randomization were detected.

The regular expressions can miss statements about randomization, or incorrectly assume there is a sentence describing randomization. The module can’t evaluate if the causal statements that are identified are warranted or not, and it only reminds users to double-check.

If you want to improve the detection of sentences describing randomization, or otherwise improve the module, reach out to the Metacheck development team.

### ℹ️ Preregistration Check {#preregistration-check .info}

We found 2 preregistrations.

Retrieve information from preregistrations in a standardised way,
and make them easier to check.

The Preregistration Check module identifies preregistrations on the OSF and AsPredicted based on links in the manuscript, retrieves the preregistration text, and organizes the information into a template. The module then uses regular expressions to identify text from AsPredicted, and the API to retrieve text from the OSF. The information in the preregistration is returned.

The module can’t extract information from non-structured preregistration templates (i.e., where the preregistration is uploaded in a single text field) and it can’t retrieve information in preregistrations that are stored as text documents on the OSF.

If you want to extend the package to be able to download information from other preregistration sites, reach out to the Metacheck development team.

## Results Modules

### ⚠️ Exact P-Values {#exact-p-values .red}

We found 1 imprecise *p* value out of 3 detected.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

Reporting *p* values imprecisely (e.g., *p* < .05) reduces transparency, reproducibility, and re-use (e.g., in *p* value meta-analyses). Best practice is to report exact p-values with three decimal places (e.g., *p* = .032) unless *p* values are smaller than 0.001, in which case you can use *p* < .001.

The APA manual states: Report exact *p* values (e.g., *p* = .031) to two or three decimal places. However, report *p* values less than .001 as *p* < .001. However, 2 decimals is too imprecise for many use-cases (e.g., a *p* value meta-analysis), so report *p* values with three digits.

List any p-values reported with insufficient precision (e.g., p < .05 or p = n.s.)

This module uses regular expressions to identify p-values. It will flag any values reported as p > ? or p < numbers greater than .001.

We try to exclude figure and table notes like "* p < .05", but may not succeed at excluding all false positives.

### ⚠️ Marginal Significance {#marginal-significance .red}

You described 2 effects with terms related to 'marginally significant'.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

You described effects with terms related to 'marginally significant'. If *p* values above 0.05 are interpreted as an effect, you inflate the alpha level, and increase the Type 1 error rate. If a *p* value is higher than the prespecified alpha level, it should be interpreted as a non-significant result.

List all sentences that describe an effect as 'marginally significant'.

The marginal module searches for regular expressions that match a predefined pattern. The list of terms is a subset of those listed in a [blog post by Matthew Hankins](https://web.archive.org/web/20251001114321/https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/). The module returns all sentences that match terms describing ‘marginally significant’ results.

Some of the terms identified might not be problematic in some contexts, and there are ways to describe ‘marginal significance’ that are not detected by the module.

Check consistency of p-values and test statistics

The Statcheck module runs Statcheck. Statcheck searches for regular expressions that match a predefined pattern, and identifies APA reported statistical tests. More information on the package can be found at <https://github.com/cran/statcheck>. The module only returns Statcheck results for t-tests and F-tests, as these are the only tests which have been validated, see <https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/tcxaj_v1/>.

Statcheck was developed by Michèle Nuijten and Sascha Epskamp.

Statcheck considers p = 0.000 an error, as you should report p < 0.001. Furthermore, p < 0.03 is an error if the p-value was 0.031, and one should simply report exact p-values (p = 0.031). Statcheck might miss one-sided tests, and falsely assume the p-value is incorrect. For more information, see [StatCheck](https://statcheck.io/).

### 🔍 Non-Significant P Value Check {#non-significant-p-value-check .yellow}

We found 2 non-significant p values that should be checked for appropriate interpretation.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

Meta-scientific research has shown nonsignificant p values are commonly misinterpreted. It is incorrect to infer that there is 'no effect', 'no difference', or that groups are 'the same' after p > 0.05.

It is possible that there is a true non-zero effect, but that the study did not detect it. Make sure your inference acknowledges that it is possible that there is a non-zero effect. It is correct to include the effect is 'not significantly' different, although this just restates that p > 0.05.

Metacheck does not yet analyze automatically whether sentences which include non-significant p-values are correct, but we recommend manually checking the sentences below for possible misinterpreted non-significant p values.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list(Text = c("p = 0.152", "p > .05"), Sentence = c("On average researchers in the experimental condition found the app marginally significantly more useful (M = 5.06) than researchers in the control condition found the checklist (M = 4.5), t(97.2) = -1.96, p = 0.152.", 
"There was no effect of experience on the reduction in errors when using the tool (p > .05), as the correlation was non-significant."
)), row.names = c(NA, -2L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"

This module checks for imprecisely reported p values. If p > .05 is detected, it warns for misinterpretations.

The nonsignificant p-value check searches for regular expressions that match a predefined pattern. The module identifies all p-values in a manuscript and selects those that are not reported to be smaller than or equal to 0.05. It returns all sentences containing non-significant p-values.

In the future, the Metacheck team aims to incorporate a machine learning classifier to only return sentences likely to contain misinterpretations. If you want to help to improve the module, reach out to the Metacheck development team.

<details><summary>View detailed feedback</summary><div>

Below, we describe some best coding practices and give the results of automatic evaluation of these practices in the code files below. This check may miss things or produce false positives if your scripts are less typical.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list("Code File Name" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R", 
"Code/Study 1.r", "Codebook/Study 1 - csv - dataset 1.csv___CODEBOOK.csv",

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 5, FALSE)
```

#### Missing Files

The scripts load files, but 1 scripts loaded files that could not be automatically identified in the repository. Check if the following files are made available, so that others can reproduce your code, or that the files are missing:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list("Code File name" = "Code/Study 1.r", Language = "R", 
    "Files loaded in code but missing in repository" = "file.csv"), row.names = 4L, class = "data.frame")

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 5, FALSE)
```

#### Hardcoded Paths

Best programming practice is to use relative file paths instead of hardcoded file paths (e.g., C://Lakens/files) as these folder names do not exist on other computers. The following hardcoded file paths were found in 4 code file(s).

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list("Code File name" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R", 
"Code/Study 1.r"), Language = c("R", "R", "R", "R"), "Absolute paths found" = c("data <- read_csv(\"C://Lakens/files/example.csv\")", 
"data <- read_csv(\"C://Lakens/files/example.csv\"), data2 <- read_csv(\"C://Lakens/files/example2.csv\")", 
"data_1 <- read.csv(\"C:/path/to/a/file.csv\")", "abs_path_pc <- read.csv(\"C:/lisa/file.csv\")"
)), row.names = c(NA, 4L), class = "data.frame")

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 5, FALSE)
```

#### Libraries / Imports

Best programming practice is to load all required libraries/imports in one block near the top of the code. In 3 code files, libraries/imports were at multiple places (i.e., with more than 3 lines in between). This was true in the following files, where libraries/imports were loaded on the following lines:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list("Code File name" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R"
), Language = c("R", "R", "R"), "Lines at which libraries/imports are loaded" = c("1, 13", 
"6, 25", "1, 11")), row.names = c(NA, 3L), class = "data.frame")

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 5, FALSE)
```

#### Code Comments

Best programming practice is to add comments to code, to explain what the code does (to yourself in the future, or peers who want to re-use your code).

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data --------------------------------------
table <- structure(list("Code File name" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R", 
"Code/Study 1.r"), Language = c("R", "R", "R", "R"), "Percentage of lines that are comments" = c("5%", 
"2%", "0%", "11%")), row.names = c(NA, 4L), class = "data.frame")

# display table -----------------------------------
metacheck::report_table(table, "auto", 5, FALSE)
```

#### README

We found 0 README files and 3 sources without READMEs: osf.io/cxjg4, https://github.com/Lakens/to_err_is_human, https://researchbox.org/4377. 

README files are a way to document the contents and structure of a folder, helping users locate the information they need. You can use a README to document changes to a repository, and explain how files are named. Please consider adding a README to each repository.

</div></details>

::: {.callout-note title="How It Works" collapse="true"}

This module retrieves information from repositories (OSF and GitHub) about code files (R, SAS, SPSS, Stata), zip files, and readme.

The Code Check module lists files on the OSF and GitHub based on links in the manuscript, and retrieves R, Rmd, Qmd, SAS, SPSS, and Stata files. The module then uses regular expressions to check the code. The regular expression search will detect the number of comments, the lines at which libraries/imports are loaded, attempts to detect absolute paths to files, and lists files that are loaded, and checks if these files are in the repository. It will also check for a readme file in the repository, and will warn it can’t examine the contents of zip files. The module will return suggestions to improve the code if there are no comments, if libraries/imports are loaded in lines further than 4 lines apart, if files that are loaded are not in the repository, and if hardcoded file paths are found.

The regular expressions can miss information in code files, or falsely detect parts of the code as a fixed file path. Libraries/imports might be loaded in one block, even if there are more than 3 intermittent lines. The package was validated internally on papers published in Psychological Science. There might be valid reasons why some loaded files can’t be shared, but the module can’t evaluate these reasons, and always gives a warning.

If you want to extend the package to be able to download files from additional data repositories, or perform additional checks on code files, or make the checks work on other types of code files, reach out to the Metacheck development team.

This module checks references for missing DOIs or DOIs with an invalid format.

This module works by identifying references that do not have a DOI or have a DOI that does not have a valid format. It then looks up these references by title, author and journal or book title in CrossRef. A DOI match is returned for the reference with the highest match above the `crossref_min_score` (default of 50).

Carefully check the returned results, as problems with reference import can lead to false positives.

This module checks references for mismatches with CrossRef.

It looks up the DOIs originally present in your paper (not those found by ref_doi_check) and returns the bibliographic information.

We then check that the title from your reference section is the same as the retrieved title (ignoring differences in capitalisation) and that all author last names in your reference section are also in the retrieved author list (we do not check first names or order yet). This check is done for all references with crossref entries, including those found by ref_doi_check, if it was previously run.

Mismatches may be because of problems with our parsing of references from your PDF (we're working on improving this), incorrect formatting in CrossRef, or minor differences in punctuation.

The Replication Check module compares the reference list against studies in the FORRT replication database based on the DOI. If a study in the database is found, a reminder is provided that a replication of the original study exists, and should be cited (currently, a warning is provided regardless of whether the replication study is already cited).

The module requires that the reference has a DOI. If you run the ref_doi_check module in a pipeline before this, it will use the enhanced DOI list from that module, otherwise it will only run on references with existing DOIs.

It is possible the original study was cited for other reasons than the empirical claim tested, or that the replication in the FORRT replication database is for only one of the studies in the paper, and not the study the authors discuss.

The database can be manually updated with the `FReD_update()`` function. For more information, see <https://forrt.org/FReD/>.

This module checks references and warns for citations in the RetractionWatch Database.

The RetractionWatch Check module compares the reference list against studies in the RetractionWatch database based on the DOI. If a study in the database is found, a reminder is provided that the study was retracted, has an expression of concern, or a correction.

The module requires that the reference has a DOI. If you run the ref_doi_check module in a pipeline before this, it will use the enhanced DOI list from that module, otherwise it will only run on references with existing DOIs.

It is possible the authors are already aware that a study was retracted, but the module can't evaluate this.

The database can be manually updated with the rw_update function. For more information, see https://gitlab.com/crossref/retraction-watch-data.

This module checks references and warns for citations that have comments on pubpeer (excluding Statcheck comments).

The PubPeer module uses the PubPeer API to check for each reference that has a DOI whether there are comments on the post-publication peer review platform. If comments are found, a link to the comments is provided. Comments by ‘Statcheck’ on PubPeer are ignored, see https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/02/heres-why-more-than-50000-psychology-studies-are-about-to-have-pubpeer-entries/.

The module requires that the reference has a DOI. If you run the doi_check module in a pipeline before this, it will use the enhanced DOI list from that module, otherwise it will only run on references with existing DOIs.

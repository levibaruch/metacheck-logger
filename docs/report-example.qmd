## Method Modules

### Preregistration Check {.info}

We found 1 preregistration from AsPredicted. Meta-scientific research has shown that deviations from preregistrations are often not reported or checked, and that the most common deviations concern the sample size. We recommend manually checking the full preregistration at the link below. If you check one aspect of the preregistration, make it the preregistered sample size.

#### Preregistered Sample Size

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("We randomly assigned 50 scientists to a condition where their manuscript was automatically checked for errors, and 50 scientists to a control condition with a checklist."), names = "", class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, 
-1L))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Full preregistration" collapse="true"}

:::

### Power {.red}

You included power analysis, but some essential reporting aspects appear missing.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("We conducted a sensitivity power analysis to determine that a Cohen's d of 0.50 is the smallest effect size that we could detect with 50 participants in each group and 80% power."), names = "", class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, 
-1L))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

Power analyses need to contain the following information to be interpretable: the statistical test, sample size, critical alpha criterion, power level, effect size, and an effect size metric. For example:

> An a priori power analysis for an independent samples t-test, conducted using the pwr.t.test function from pwr (Champely, 2020) with Cohen's d = 0.5 and a critical alpha of p = 0.05, determined that 64 participants are required in each group for 80% power.

## Results Modules

### Exact P-Values {.red}

We found 1 imprecise *p* value out of 3 detected. Reporting *p* values imprecisely (e.g., *p* < .05) reduces transparency, reproducibility, and re-use (e.g., in *p* value meta-analyses). Best practice is to report exact p-values with three decimal places (e.g., *p* = .032) unless *p* values are smaller than 0.001, in which case you can use *p* < .001.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("P-Value" = "p > .05", Sentence = "There was no effect of experience on the reduction in errors when using the tool (p > .05), as the correlation was non-significant."), row.names = c(NA, 
-1L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))

# table options
cd <- list(list(targets = 0, width = "10%"), list(targets = 1, width = "90%"))
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Learn More" collapse="true"}

The APA manual states: Report exact *p* values (e.g., *p* = .031) to two or three decimal places. However, report *p* values less than .001 as *p* < .001. However, 2 decimals is too imprecise for many use-cases (e.g., a *p* value meta-analysis), so report *p* values with three digits.

American Psychological Association_, 7 edition. American Psychological
Association.

### Non-Significant P Value Check {.yellow}

We found 2 non-significant p values that should be checked for appropriate interpretation.

Meta-scientific research has shown nonsignificant p values are commonly misinterpreted. It is incorrect to infer that there is 'no effect', 'no difference', or that groups are 'the same' after p > 0.05.

It is possible that there is a true non-zero effect, but that the study did not detect it. Make sure your inference acknowledges that it is possible that there is a non-zero effect. It is correct to include the effect is 'not significantly' different, although this just restates that p > 0.05.

Metacheck does not yet analyze automatically whether sentences which include non-significant p-values are correct, but we recommend manually checking the sentences below for possible misinterpreted non-significant p values.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list(Text = c("p = 0.152", "p > .05"), Sentence = c("On average researchers in the experimental condition found the app marginally significantly more useful (M = 5.06) than researchers in the control condition found the checklist (M = 4.5), t(97.2) = -1.96, p = 0.152.", 
"There was no effect of experience on the reduction in errors when using the tool (p > .05), as the correlation was non-significant."
)), row.names = c(NA, -2L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

# table options
cd <- list(list(targets = 0, width = "10%"), list(targets = 1, width = "90%"))
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

:::

### Marginal Significance {.red}

You described effects with terms related to 'marginally significant'. If *p* values above 0.05 are interpreted as an effect, you inflate the alpha level, and increase the Type 1 error rate. If a *p* value is higher than the prespecified alpha level, it should be interpreted as a non-significant result.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list(section = c("abstract", "results"), text = c("The paper shows examples of (1) open and closed OSF links; (2a) citation of retracted papers, (2b) citations without a doi, (2c) citations with Pubpeer comments, (2d) citations in the FORTT replication database, and (2e) missing/mismatched/incorrect citations and references; (3a) R files with code on GitHub that do not load libraries in one location, (3b) load files that are not shared in the repository, (3c) lack comments, and (3d) have hard-coded files, (4) imprecise reporting of non-significant pvalues; (5) tests with and without effect sizes, (6) use of \"marginally significant\" to describe non-significant findings, and (7) retrieving information from preregistrations.",

)), row.names = c(NA, -2L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

### Effect Sizes in t-tests and F-tests {.red}

We found 1 t-test and/or F-test where effect sizes are not reported. We recommend checking the sentences below, and add any missing effect sizes.

The following sentences are missing effect sizes

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("On average researchers in the experimental condition found the app marginally significantly more useful (M = 5.06) than researchers in the control condition found the checklist (M = 4.5), t(97.2) = -1.96, p = 0.152."), names = "", class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, 
-1L))

### Code Check {.yellow}

Below, we describe some best coding practices and give the results of automatic evaluation of these practices in the R files below. This check may miss things or produce false positives if your R scripts are less typical.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("R File Name" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R"
), Download = c("<a href='https://osf.io/download/6935bc117049c887a125cb25/'>download</a>", 
"<a href='https://osf.io/download/uq347/'>download</a>", "<a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakens/to_err_is_human/main/analysis.R'>download</a>"
)), row.names = c(NA, -3L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

#### Missing Files

The scripts load files, but 3 scripts loaded 3 files that could not be automatically identified in the repository. Check if the following files are made available, so that others can reproduce your code, or that the files are missing:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("R File names" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R"
), "Files loaded in R file but missing in repository" = c("example.csv", 
"example.csv", "file.csv")), row.names = c(NA, -3L), class = c("tbl_df", 
"tbl", "data.frame"))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

#### Hardcoded Paths

Best programming practice is to use relative file paths instead of hardcoded file paths (e.g., C://Lakens/files) as these folder names are do not exist on other computers. The following 4 hardcoded file paths were found in 3 R file(s).

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("R File names" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "bad.Rmd", 
"analysis.R"), "Absolute paths found" = c("data <- read_csv(\"C://Lakens/files/example.csv\")", 
"data <- read_csv(\"C://Lakens/files/example.csv\")", "data2 <- read_csv(\"C://Lakens/files/example2.csv\")", 
"data_1 <- read.csv(\"C:/path/to/a/file.csv\")")), class = c("tbl_df", 
"tbl", "data.frame"), row.names = c(NA, -4L))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

#### Libraries

Best programming practice is to load all required libraries at one place in the code. In 3 R files, libraries were at multiple places in the R files (i.e., with more than 3 lines in between). This was true in the following R files, where libraries were loaded on the following lines:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("R File names" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R"
), "Lines at which libraries are loaded" = c("1, 16", "9, 38", 
"1, 16")), row.names = c(NA, -3L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", 
"data.frame"))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

#### Code Comments

Best programming practice is to add comments to code, to explain what the code does (to yourself in the future, or peers who want to re-use your code. The following 1 file had no comments:

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list("R File names" = c("bad.R", "bad.Rmd", "analysis.R"
), "Total Lines" = c(19, 45, 19), "Code Lines" = c(13, 30, 13
), Comments = c(1, 1, 0), "Percent comments" = c("5%", "2%", 
"0%")), row.names = c(NA, -3L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

# table options
cd <- list()
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)
```

### StatCheck {.red}

We detected possible errors in test statistics. Note that as the accuracy of statcheck has only been validated for *t*-tests and *F*-tests. As Metacheck only uses validated modules, we only provide statcheck results for *t* tests and *F*-tests.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# table data
table <- structure(list(Text = "t(97.2) = -1.96, p = 0.152", "Recomputed p" = 0.05286, 
    Section = "results", Sentence = "On average researchers in the experimental condition found the app marginally significantly more useful (M = 5.06) than researchers in the control condition found the checklist (M = 4.5), t(97.2) = -1.96, p = 0.152."), row.names = 2L, class = c("statcheck", 
"data.frame"))

# table options
cd <- list(list(targets = 0, width = "10em"))
options <- list(dom = "t", ordering = FALSE, columnDefs = cd )

# display table
DT::datatable(table, options, selection = "none", rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE)

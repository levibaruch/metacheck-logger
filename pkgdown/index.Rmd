Metacheck provides extendable and integrated tools for automatically checking research outputs for best practices. (formerly named papercheck)

Inspired by practices in software development, where automated checks (e.g., CRAN checks for R packages) are used to identify issues before release, metacheck aims to screen scientific manuscripts to identify potential issues or areas for improvement and guide researchers in adopting best practices. It can also assist with processing large numbers of papers for metascientific enquiry.

See [Get Started](articles/metacheck.html) for the basics, [Articles](articles/) for more detailed examples of what you can do, or our [introductory blog post](articles/intro.html) for a more conceptual overview.

## The Team

Metacheck is developed by a collaborative team of researchers, consisting of (from left to right in the picture below) [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io) (developer and maintainer), 
[Daniël Lakens](https://sites.google.com/site/lakens2/Home) (developer), 
[René Bekkers](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/rene-bekkers) (collaborator and PI of [Transparency Check](https://tdcc.nl/tdcc-ssh-challenge-projects/research-transparency-check)), 
[Cristian Mesquida](https://ssreplicationcentre.com/author/cristian-mesquida/) (postdoctoral researcher), 
and Max Littel, Jakub Werner, Hadeel Khawatmy, and Lavinia Ion (research assistants). 

Metacheck was initially developed by Lisa and Daniël in 2024 during Lisa’s visiting professorship at the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute ([EAISI](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute)).
